    <h1>debuild.me</h1>
    <p>debuild.me is a buildd network, run by friends, to help
       automagically lint, build and test Debian packages.</p>
    <p>The name comes from the Debian tool of the same name --
        <a href = 'http://deb.li/JHns' >debuild</a>, which builds
        Debian packages. Although we don't use `debuild' under the
        hood, it's still a mighty fiting name.</p>
